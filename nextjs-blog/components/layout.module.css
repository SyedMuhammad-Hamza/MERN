  /* To use CSS Modules, the CSS file name must end with .module.css 
  This is what CSS Modules does: It automatically generates unique class names. As long as you use CSS Modules, you donâ€™t have to worry about class name collisions.
 CSS Modules are extracted from the JavaScript bundles at build time and generate .css files that are loaded automatically by Next.js
 In Next.js, you can add global CSS files by importing them from pages/_app.js. You cannot import global CSS anywhere else.
